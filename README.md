##What's this?

This is a cui-based note application.

##How to install

```
$ npm install -g note-js
```

Unfortunately, I don't deploy it to npm yet. So, you need install it by below command.

```
$ npm install -g https://github.com/yujilow1220/note-js.git
```

##Future works

 - Add function of deployment to Git Repository
 - Deploy it into npm
